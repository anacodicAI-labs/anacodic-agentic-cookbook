# Contributing to the Anacodic Agentic Cookbook

Thank you for your interest in contributing. Whether it's a bug report, a new
experiment, a documentation fix, or a new use case, we value contributions
from the community.

Please read through this document before opening an issue or a pull request.

## Ways to contribute

1. **Add an experiment** under `02-experiments/` — the one door in for new
   work. Try anything: a new approach to a stage, an alternative to something
   in `01-modules/`, or an attempt at a benchmark number. Not required to win
   — see "the promotion path" below for what happens next. New notebooks here
   follow
   [`02-experiments/NOTEBOOK_STANDARD.md`](02-experiments/NOTEBOOK_STANDARD.md)
   — read it before you open a blank notebook.
2. **Fix bugs, improve documentation, or clarify a README.**

`03-use-cases/` is not a place to start. It is reserved for one thin
demonstration that the stages compose, written by the lab. Everything else
enters through `02-experiments/`.

No contribution is too small.

## How work is organized

```
01-modules/        maintained by the lab. read these, don't edit them in your
                   first PR — see "the promotion path" below.
  01-tools/          how the agent DOES things. six sub-stages that together
                     build one retrieval tool, plus 07-as-a-tool.
  02-memory/         what it carries forward, short-term and long-term.
  03-guardrails/     what it may never do.
  04-orchestrate/    what happens next — the decision loop.
  05-observe/        what actually happened — cost, artifacts, tracing.
02-experiments/    your attempts. one folder per contribution:
                     02-experiments/<your-name>-<topic>/
03-use-cases/      reserved for one thin demo that the stages compose.
                   empty for now, by intent — see its README.
04-benchmarks/     frozen inputs, hand-checked gold answers, and a
                   LEADERBOARD.md per benchmark.
```

Two people are never asked to edit the same file. Add a new folder for your
work; do not modify someone else's.

### Which part to take

Each of the five parts under `01-modules/` is owned by one person at a time —
that's the unit of work here, not a file and not a whole repo. You need to
understand your part, not all of them.

| Part | Read first | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| `01-tools` | `01-tools/04-retrieve/` | nothing — but it's the largest |
| `02-memory` | `01-tools/03-embed/` | nothing. Good standalone start. |
| `03-guardrails` | `01-tools/05-gate/` | nothing. Correctness matters more than volume here. |
| `04-orchestrate` | `01-tools/04-retrieve/08-backend-cascade.ipynb`, `01-tools/05-gate/` | `01-tools/07-as-a-tool` |
| `05-observe` | `nbio.py` | nothing. Self-contained; a good first part. |

`02-memory`, `03-guardrails` and `05-observe` have no dependency on unfinished
work and can be picked up immediately.

## Where a contribution can go next

A folder in `02-experiments/` is the start, not the end. Depending on what it
does, it can lead to up to three places — and it can lead to more than one of
them at once:

- **A leaderboard row in `04-benchmarks/*/LEADERBOARD.md`**, if it beats or
  measures a benchmark number. This is self-serve: run the benchmark's
  `eval.py`, open a PR appending your row with the evidence behind it (see
  the benchmark's own README) — no promotion or lab review needed to report a
  real result.
- **Hand-checked gold answers in `04-benchmarks/*/gold/`**, if you can supply
  them. This needs real domain judgment (a benchmark's `gold/README.md`
  states what kind) and is treated as its own contribution, not a step
  toward one of the other two.
- **Promotion into `01-modules/`**, decided by the lab, not
  self-serve. `01-modules/` is not closed to new work — it is a destination:
  if something in `02-experiments/` is a better reference way to do a stage,
  the lab promotes it into the relevant `01-modules/` notebook, crediting the
  original folder and its author in the commit and in `CONTRIBUTORS.md`.
  Open a PR against `02-experiments/` first — `01-modules/` changes only as a
  promotion, reviewed with extra care because every stage folder is read by
  newcomers as the reference implementation.

## Fork and pull request workflow

We use a fork workflow for everyone, including lab members — the repo is
public, and one path is one less thing to explain.

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Branch** from `main` on your fork: `<your-name>/<topic>`, e.g.
   `your-name/handwriting-ocr`.
3. **Make your changes**, inside your own folder under `02-experiments/`.
4. **Run `nbstripout`** before committing (installed via `pre-commit`, see
   below) so notebook outputs — which can carry a stray key or an identifier
   printed during debugging — never reach the diff.
5. **Commit** with clear, informative messages.
6. **Stay up to date** with `main` before opening a pull request.
7. **Push to your fork and open a pull request.** Describe what you tried and
   what the benchmark showed, if applicable.

Install the commit hooks once, locally:

```bash
pip install pre-commit nbstripout
pre-commit install
```

## What must never be in a pull request

- A `.env` file, or any real API key, in code or in a notebook's output cells.
- Any dataset containing patient data, real student work, or another
  identifiable person's information.
- Files over 5 MB. The pre-commit hook rejects these; if your contribution
  genuinely needs a larger asset, open an issue first so we can discuss where
  it belongs.

## Credit

Decided and written down before anyone joins, not negotiated at submission:

- **Moved a benchmark number that lands in a paper** → named in that paper's
  Methods section, and co-authorship on it.
- **Maintained a stage** (had work promoted into `01-modules/`, or actively
  reviews contributions in an area) → maintainer credit in `CONTRIBUTORS.md`,
  permanent.
- **All contributed work stays public and attributable** to you, regardless of
  what happens to any product built on top of it.

## Reporting issues

Found a problem or have a suggestion? Open a GitHub issue with as much detail
as you can — a reproducible example, what you expected, and what happened
instead.

## Code of Conduct

We will ask you to confirm this on your first pull request with a one-line
comment: *"I have read and agree to the CONTRIBUTING terms."*

This is a lightweight contributor agreement so the project can be reused and
